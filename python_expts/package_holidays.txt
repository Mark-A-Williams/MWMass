Yes I quite agree with you, I mean what's the point of being treated like a sheep, 
I mean I'm fed up with going abroad and being treated like a sheep; 
what's the point of being carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty mindless 
oafs from Kettering and Boventry in their cloth caps and their cardigans and 
their transistor radios and their 'Sunday Mirrors', complaining about the tea, 
'Oh they don't make it properly here do they, not like at home', stopping at Majorcan 
bodegas, selling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and calamares and two veg 
and sitting in cotton sun frocks squirting Timothy White's suncream all over their 
puffy raw swollen purulent flesh cos they 'overdid it on the first day'!
