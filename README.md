My MPhys project!!!


python_expts/RR43experiment.ipynb is the interesting bit, with light curves and growth curves

Also in the python_expts folder is all of the messing around with Python I've done in the last couple of weeks including photutils and astropy things

GaiaID.csv is a complete list of all the Gaia IDs, funnily enough
